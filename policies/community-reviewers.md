# Community Reviewer Policy

This document describes the privileges and expectations of community reviewers

## Reasoning

While any community member may review a PR in the OpenSSL repository, the
recognition of community reviewers serves to create greater agency in our
community by affording willing members the ability to have their reviews
"count" toward the required number of reviews for inclusion in our code base.
This also reduces the workload of those in the committer and OTC groups within
the organization in an effort to more quickly process our PR backlog

## Privileges

Those community members who are in the OpenSSL reviewers group, do _not_ have
access to modify the code base on their own (differentiating them from
committers).  However, they enjoy the privilege of being able to preform reviews
that are taken into account when merging, by being recognized as a review toward
the minimum required number before a change can be merged.

## Responsibilities 

Community members who are in the reviewers group are expected to perform reviews
on a regular basis.  Reviewers who do not perform a minimum of one review per
release, can be removed from the group at the discretion of the OTC.

## Nomination and Approval

Community members wishing to become part of the reviewers group may petition the
OTC by creating a pull request against this repository, making a change to the
list below to add their name/email.  Such pull requests will be reviewed by the
OTC, and voted on.  Reviewers wishing to join should, in the commit log of their
pull request list reviews that they have completed prior to the opening of the
nominating pull request, so that OTC may consider their prior work.  A minimum
of 5 reviews is required for consideration.
